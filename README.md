In this video, I have shown how the user fills in the form input, and the transaction is stored in the database.
When the user clicks on 'Add Transaction,' the data is saved in the database and also displayed in the transaction history.
If the user mistakenly enters an incorrect transaction, they can delete it by clicking the red box on the left of the transaction.
When the user deletes a transaction, the data is also removed from the database table.
